# wikipedia-search-client
This repository is the react and apollo-client client side of the project to test out typescript, graphql and react stack by using wikipedia api.

It only has one page to search for wikipedia articles

#Â Features
- debounced search to decrease api calls
- loading ui feedbacks with skeletons
- simple ui
- seamless search



At the time, this client is tried to be hosted on https://wikipedia-search-client.herokuapp.com/ but I couldn't make it work. I will keep trying some time later.

If you want to try this on your local network you will fail to download graph schema because apollo_key is not committed in the source. So please reach out to me in case you want to locally try this.
